------------------------------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
`pizza-order-*`, `pizza-cooking-*`, `pizza-delivery-*`  | These modules represent 3 microservices and their APIs (Pizza Cooking, Delivery, and Order) that demonstrate various OAuth 2.0 flows (e.g., token introspection, JWKS, client credentials), roles-based access control and security logging concepts.                                                                                         |
`security-feign-logger-enricher`                        | Enriches and enables standard Feign client logging with additional custom Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC) attributes (e.g., correlation ID) using SLF4J's MDC.                                                                                                                                                                                |
`security-slf4j-logger-enricher`                        | Enriches SLF4J-based logging with security-specific attributes (e.g., remote host, remote port, user agent, request URI, request method, correlation ID) using SLF4J's MDC.                                                                                                                                                                   |
`security-token-client-credentials-fetcher`             | Fetches tokens from the Identity Provider (IdP) using the client credentials flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
`security-token-introspection`                          | Introspects and validates access tokens using the IdP's token introspection endpoint. Additionally, it disables security for specific `/public` endpoints (e.g., OpenAPI definition endpoint), configures CORS and Content Security Policy (CSP), adds HTTP security headers, and parses JWT claim roles, adding them as granted authorities. |
`security-token-jwks`                                   | Handles JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) validation and signature verification of JWT tokens using the IdP's JWKS endpoint. Additionally, it disables security for specific `/public` endpoints (e.g., OpenAPI definition endpoint) and parses JWT claim roles, adding them as granted authorities.                                                    |
`serialization-deserialization`                         | Demonstrates security risks in serialization and deserialization, including exploits like Java class deserialization attacks, XML external entities, YAML bombs, and ZIP bombs.                                                                                                                                                               |

- [GIT bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
 
### Compile, Run Tests, and Package

To compile the project, run tests, and package it, use the following command:

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

### Bootstrap Services with Docker

Please ensure that the Docker daemon is running; otherwise, the commands will not execute successfully.

1. Run the following command to start the `Keycloak` service in Docker:

    ```bash
    ./bootstrap-keycloak.sh
    ```

2. To start the `Pizza` application, which includes multiple microservices running in Docker, execute:
   
    ```bash
    ./bootstrap-pizza-application.sh
    ```

3. Next, run the following command to start the `OWASP WebGoat` application in Docker:
   
    ```bash
    ./bootstrap-webgoat.sh
    ```

4. Finally, check that all Docker containers are up and running by executing:

    ```bash
    docker ps -a
    ```

### Keycloak Configuration

To set up a basic Keycloak configuration, run the following script:

```bash
./keycloak-init.sh
```

The script creates OAuth 2.0 clients, users, and roles under the `master` realm and assigns the roles to the users:

 Type         | Name                  | Password                           | Purpose                                     |
--------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
 User         | `demo_user`           | `Test1234!`                        | Used for authorization code flow with PKCE. |
 Client ID    | `demo_public_client`  | `6EuUNXQzFmxu6xwPHDvvoh56z1uzrBMw` | Used for authorization code flow.           |
 Client ID    | `demo_private_client` | `6EuUNXQzFmxu6xwPHDvvoh56z1uzrBMw` | Used for client credentials flow.           |

This setup utilizes [Keycloak's REST API](https://www.keycloak.org/docs-api/latest/rest-api/index.html) to perform these operations and provides output at each step, ensuring efficient user and client management within the Keycloak environment.

### Services Overview via UI

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:9090 to access the **Keycloak UI** (using the credentials `admin:admin`).

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:9090/realms/master/.well-known/openid-configuration to access the **Keycloak OpenID Connect configuration**.

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:18080/public/swagger-ui/index.html to access the **Pizza Order OpenAPI definition**.

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:48080/WebGoat/login to access the **OWASP WebGoat UI**.

### Local Tests with Postman

1. Open `Postman` and import the [Postman collection](postman).
2. To simulate a basic test scenario, follow these steps in the given sequence:
  - a) Fetch the JWT token using either:
    - The **Password Flow**:
       ```
       POST http://localhost:9090/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token
       ```
    - Or the **Client Credentials Flow**:
       ```
       POST http://localhost:9090/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token
       ```      
    - Or the **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE**:
       ```
       POST http://localhost:9090/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/auth
       ```   
  - b) Initiate an order request to the `pizza-order-service`:
       ```
       POST http://localhost:18080/pizza/orders
       ```

## Security Checks

### OWASP Dependency-Check

[OWASP Dependency-Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check) is an open-source **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** tool that identifies vulnerabilities in project dependencies, helping reveal and address known security risks.

To check for potential dependency vulnerabilities, execute the following command:

```bash
./mvnw clean compile org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check
```

**Note:** The first run of this command might take a significant amount of time (e.g., a couple of minutes) to initially download the [NVD Data Feeds](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds) hosted by NIST. 

### SpotBugs with FindSecBugs Plugin

[Spotbugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) is an open-source static analysis tool that detects bugs in Java programs by analyzing bytecode.

With the help of the [FindSecBugs plugin](https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/) plugin, it can be used as a **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** tool to identify security vulnerabilities in Java applications.

To check for potential code vulnerabilities, execute the following command:

```bash
./mvnw clean compile spotbugs:check
```

### Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)

[The Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) is an open-source **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** tool specifically designed for identifying vulnerabilities in applications during runtime.

To check for API security vulnerabilities, execute the following command:

```bash
./zap-scan.sh
```

The command starts ZAP in Docker, launches an API scan using the [zap-api-scan rules](zap/zap-api-scan-rules.conf) against one of the services, and saves the scan report in the [./zap/reports](zap/reports) folder.
